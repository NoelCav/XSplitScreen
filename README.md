## Features

- Multiple monitor support
- Custom colors
- Config option to auto enable if controllers are available

## Planned

## Known Issues

- If the configuration is invalid clicking Enable Mod does nothing
- Profiles sometimes 'forget' the last used character
- Any user can change the loadout of the user who last refreshed the loadout panel
- Users can equip skills their profiles haven't unlocked
- Some buttons can still become unbound when entering a run
- Potential poor compatibility with other mods will be addressed in the future
- When using the Command Cube / scrapping the camera will jump to another player
- Scoreboard UI does not work in multiplayer
- Some options in the assignment screen can only be interacted with using the mouse
- Sometimes the default cursor visual remains enabled
- Using multiple monitors may cause issues. Please join the Discord to report them
